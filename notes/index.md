# The Doppio Group

(This is a [work in progress][doppio_gh]).

This site will describe the construction of a group called "Doppio",
designed to provide a prime-order group for use inside of a
[Bulletproof][bp].  Doppio uses the Decaf construction on a curve
defined over the [ristretto255][ristretto255] scalar field and also
serves as a worked example of how to use Decaf with elliptic curves
embedded in zero-knowledge proof systems.
